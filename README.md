# Implement a doubly linked list.

Like an array, a linked list is a simple linear data structure. Several common data types can be implemented using linked lists, like queues, stacks, and associative arrays.

A linked list is a collection of data elements called nodes. In a singly linked list each node holds a value and a link to the next node. In a doubly linked list each node also holds a link to the previous node.

## Requirements
 * PHP 8.x

## Run with Docker
```shell
docker run -it --rm --name my-running-script -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp php:8-cli-alpine php client.php
```
